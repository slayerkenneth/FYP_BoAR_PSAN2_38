Boarlord: You and I are one and the same, from different timelines in the multiverse.
Tom: Then why did you fight against me?
Boarlord: I didn't want to let you win. Now that I've been defeated, it's time to say goodbye.
Boarlord: When you fully synchronise all versions of yourself, I will disappear, because I am you.
Tom:  I now know. I'll never forget the lessons we learned through our battles together. You helped me realize that life can be both fun and meaningful. Thank you, my friend.
