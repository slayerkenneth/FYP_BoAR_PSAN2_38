Boarlord: You and I are one and the same, from different timelines in the multiverse..
Tom: Huh? Then why did you fight against me?
Boarlord: I didn't want to let you win that easily. But now, it's time to say goodbye.
Tom: Where are you going now?
Boarlord: You have fully harnessed the power to synchronise with all versions of yourself. When you do, I will disappear, because I am you.
Tom: Oh. Our battles made me realise that life can be fun and meaningful. I won't forget you...thank you friend.
